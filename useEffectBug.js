This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  The function might not be properly compared for changes, leading to unexpected re-renders or infinite loops. This is because React only does a shallow comparison on the dependency array. If the function is recreated on each render, React treats it as a different object, triggering a re-render, even if the function's logic hasn't changed.
