The solution is to use `useCallback` to memoize the function. This ensures that the function reference remains the same across renders as long as the dependencies of `useCallback` remain unchanged.  This prevents React from treating the function as a new object each time.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means increment is only created once

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count updated:', count);
    // Perform side effects here
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
